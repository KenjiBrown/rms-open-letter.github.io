Richard Stallman is being unfairly linched and defamed by a group pf people in an open letter to the FSF. They are asking for him to be expelled from an organization he created, he commited his live to, and he deserves more than any one of us to be head of. 

We, the undersigned, belive in freedom as a human right. Freedom of speach is what Richard Stallman is being attacked for. In order to realize the promise of everything freedom makes possible, we must defend free speech and we must defend our community members against this kind of attacks to free speech based on false acusations and regrettable hate campaigns. Such hate campaigns as we know only lead to division and self destruction.

We acknowledge that some of Richard Stallman's opinions are controversial. Some of us might have different opinions, but we are grown enough to differentiate an opinion from bad behaviour. Commenting about a controversial topic is not a crime and should never be a crime. Commenting about a controversial topic should have never been a reason for Richard Stallman (or any one else) to loose his job, his reputation, his position and access to the ptojects he has been devoted to most of his life.

We accept and recognize Richard as a human being with strengths and weaknesses as any one else. We are thankful for all the work he has done in the past years in favor of software freedom. We acknowledge the need for more people like Richard in the head of key organizations like the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project.

There has been enough damage against Richard Stallman, the Free Software Foundation and the Free software movement as a whole. We have had enough. We have had enough *ad-hóminem* attacks targeted against Free Software representatives. We have had enough divisive attacks aiming to leave our Free Software Movement weaker than ever before.

**We are calling for the endorsement of Richard M. Stallman as a Board member of the Free Software Foundation.** FSF members should recognize Richard for his commitment to software freedom and for his great job all these years. They should embrace freedom as a whole, despite of malicious dafamation attacks comming from people with personal interests against the person and the movement. It is time for RMS to recover his lost position and never step back again. Free Software Movement needs more people with such a commitment for Free Software's ideals. 

**We are also calling for Richard M. Stallman to be restored to his original position as FSF's president and keep his current position in the GNU Project.** 

We urge those in a position to do so to keep supporting Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. Keep contributing to projects related to the FSF and RMS. Keep attending to FSF events, and events that welcome RMS and other Free Software representatives. We ask for contributors to Free Software projects to take a stand against bigotry and hate within their projects. While doing these things, tell these communities the value of Freedom. 

We acknowledge all of Richard Stallman's contributions to software freedom. Some of us have our own stories about RMS and our interactions with him. We have welcomed him in our homes and our universities. We have learned to know him as the humen he is, with his strengths and weaknesses, things that are not captured in email threads or on video. We hope you will read what has been shared and consider the harm some malicious people are doing to our community.
