Richard M. Stallman is being unfairly linched and defamed by the above signing. They are asking for him to be expelled from an organization he created, he commited his live to, and he deserves more than any one of us to be head of. 

We, the undersigned, believe in the necessity of digital autonomy and the powerful role user freedom plays in protecting our fundamental human rights. In order to realize the promise of everything freedom makes possible, we must defend free speech and we must defend our members (including Richard M. Stallman) against false acusations and regrettable hate campaigns. It's not the way to build a cibilization. It's not the way to achieve freedom. Hate campaigns as we know only lead to division and self destruction. 

We know some of Richard M. Stallman's opinions are controversial, some of us might have different opinions, but we are grown enough to differentiate when he speaks for us as a global movement and when he speaks for himself as a human beeing with right to free speach. We accept and recognize Richard as a human being and we are thankful for all the work he has done in the past years in favor of software freedom. We acknowledge the need for more people like Richard in the head of key organizations like the free Software foundation and the GNU project.

There has been enough damage against Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. We have had enough *Ad Hominem* attacks targeted against Free Software Movment. We have had enough divisive attacks leaving our Free Software Movement weaker than ever before.

**We are calling for the endorsement of richard M. Stallman as a Board member of the Free Software Foundation.** FSF members are the only ones commited to Free Software despite diversions from external individuals unrelated to Free Software. They demonstrate commitment to Free Software's ideals by permitting him to rejoin the FSF Board. It is time for RMS to recover his lost position and never step back again. Free Software Movement needs more people with such a commitment for Free Software's ideals. **We are also calling for Richard M. Stallman to be restored to his original position as FSF's president and keep his current position in the GNU Project.** 

We urge those in a position to do so to keep supporting Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. Keep contributing to projects related to the FSF and RMS. Keep attending to FSF events, and events that welcome RMS and other FSF members. We ask for contributors to free software projects to take a stand against bigotry and hate within their projects. While doing these things, tell these communities the value of Freedom. 

We acknowledge all of Richard M. Stallman's contributions to software freedom. Some of us have our own stories about RMS and our interactions with him. We have welcomed him in our homes and our universities. We have learned to know him as the humen he is, with his strengths and weaknesses, things that are not captured in email threads or on video. We hope you will read what has been shared and consider the harm some malicious people are doing to our community.
